## Project Description

In this project we, *Tim, Kim and Laura,* performed a data analysis on a dataset with information about the air quality of Barcelona in November 2018. We chose the topic because one of our team members has experience in this field. 

 

## Questions & Hypotheses

Questions

Is there any realationship between polutants?
What is the most polluted day of the month?
What is the most polluted day of the week?
What is the most polluted hour of the month?
Which station is the most polluted?
Which station has the best air quality?

Hypotheses

We had already assumptions on what we could find. We expected to notice relationship between pollutants as they interact together in the air.
We expect to find more pollution during the week an on rush hours, in more centric areas in the city.


## Dataset
Dataset : Air Quality Barcelona 2018

The Dataset contains informations for 3 different values measured in 8 different stations in Barcelona.


## Database

Table 1: air-quality-nov-2018.csv (raw data)
Table 2: air_quality_bcn_18_clean (cleaned data)
Table 3: station_locations.csv

## Workflow

The workflow of this project was very agile. We brainstormed the rough organization and the steps to take in the project and documented them in Trello.

## Organization

For the organization of this project we used a board on Trello.
Tim created a repository and gave Laura and Kim access as contributors. We then made branches of the main branch in the repository for each team member. After we cleaned the data, we merged all data cleaning files into the main branch from our individual branches.
