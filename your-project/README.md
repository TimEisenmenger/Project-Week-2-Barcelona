## Project Description

In this project we, *Tim, Kim and Laura,* performed a data analysis on a dataset with information about the air quality of Barcelona in November 2018. We chose the topic because one of our team members has experience in this field.

 


## Questions & Hypotheses
Questions
Tim:

Kim:
What is the most polluted day of the month?
What is the most polluted day of the week?
What is the most polluted hour of the month?
- Before answering it was not possible to get a feeling what the answer could be, since it is a huge dataset!

Laura:

Hypotheses


What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data?

The Dataset contains informations for 3 different values measured in 8 different stations in Barcelona.

What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other?

## Workflow
The workflow of this project was bery agile. We brainstormed the rough organization and the steps to take in the project and documented them in Trello.

Trello Board
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization

For the organization of this project we used a board on Trello.
Tim created a repository and gave Laura and Kim access as contributors. We then made branches of the main branch in the repository for each team member. After we cleaned the data, we merged all data cleaning files into the main branch from our individual branches.


How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
